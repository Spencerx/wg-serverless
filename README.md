# CNCF Serverless WG

The original intent of the CNCF Serverless Working Group was to explore the
intersection of cloud native and serverless technology. As a result of that
work the following artifacts were produced:

* [A Serverless Overview Whitepaper](#serverless-overview-whitepaper)
* [Landscape](#landscape)

Since then the working group has expanded its mission to include a set of
sub-projects:
- [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) ([repo](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec))
- [Serverless Workflow](https://serverlessworkflow.io) ([repo](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow))

While the serverless working group acts as a focal point for serverless
relating CNCF activities, each sub-project is independent and defines their
own processes, governance model and work. Periodically, each sub-project should
join the serverless working group's weekly call to provide an informational
update on any key activities that might be of interest to the broader
serverless community.

Additional work streams can be suggested, see the proposal directory's
[README](proposals/README.md) for more information.

The TOC sponsor of this WG is Ken Owens.
